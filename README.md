#### [My Notes on React Basic Concepts Notes](/REACT-BASIC-CONCEPTS.MD)

#### Webpack
Webpack is the module bundler for the React Applications

#### Babel 
Babel is the transpiler which converts JSX and Javascript code into ES5 Javascript code which can be run on most of the browsers

#### ESLint 
ESLint is the linting tool used by React. It is used to capture language related issues, and can also be used to enforce code style and good practices.

#### Prettier
Prettier helps in formatting our code.

#### Minification
It is the process of minimising code without affecting how the resource is processed by the browser. It is achieved by ermoving dead code, comments, and shortening the names of variables and functions.

#### React can be gradually adopted(https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-website.html)
You can add React to just a little parts of your HTML page where some interactivity is required, or as a small part into Angular applications.

#### The React team primarily recommends these solutions for scalable Prod Ready React Applications:
- If you’re learning React or creating a new single-page app, use Create React App.
- If you’re building a server-rendered website with Node.js, try Next.js.
- If you’re building a static content-oriented website, try Gatsby.
- If you’re building a component library or integrating with an existing codebase, try More Flexible Toolchains.
    - Neutrino combines the power of webpack with the simplicity of presets, and includes a preset for React apps and React components.
    - nwb is particularly great for publishing React components for npm. It can be used for creating React apps, too.
    - Parcel is a fast, zero configuration web application bundler that works with React.
    - Razzle is a server-rendering framework that doesn’t require any configuration, but offers more flexibility than Next.js.
